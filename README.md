The .NET Framework provides several ways of managing data within your application. Choosing the right tool for the job can help your app manage memory more efficiently and provide users with better performance. In this advanced course, learn the differences between structs, classes, and records in C#. Each data type has its own semantics for common scenarios such as equality testing, implementing behavior, and value/reference typing. All three data types provide great ways of working with structured data, but each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Tune in to better understand how these features can help you improve your code.

This course includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad. Code Challenges are interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback, so you can get hands-on coding practice alongside the course content to advance your programming skills.
